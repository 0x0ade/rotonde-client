# Rotonde/client

The client, or *Rotonde Core*, is the client base that only contributors need to worry about maintaining or updating. This separation allows for a simplier onboarding and updating flow, where the latest client revision will be seeded automatically, while the [user](https://github.com/Rotonde/user) source is all that any simple user need to maintain.
